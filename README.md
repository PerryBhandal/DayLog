# daylog
A tool I use to track my life. From how much I weigh, to what I eat, to when I shower. It helps me develop better habits and be productive.

More details will come once the software is in better shape. The plan here is:

1) Continue using the existing code and adding new features.
2) I'll make some small improvement to the rails version, like:
  - Being able to paste images in the journals from your clipboard.
  - Making it easier to enter common tasks like flossing, brushing my teeth.
3) Then I'll re-make the software in Django, and write software to translate data from the sqlite database generated by the current version of DayLog and the SaaS version of it. That version will have a native mobile app as well which lets you:
  - Add tracking for how much you lift in the gym.
  - And more...
